# SFS_ESM_Utility
Spaceflight Simulator Custom Part Pack with some Utilities that expand the experiance but don't break game mechanics.

Currently Release Items
1. Truss Seperators, now you can see what is between your stages (also capable of changing colour/shapes)
2. Cargobay, for when you want to launch a shuttle worth of payload.
3. 45 Degree struts and connector for more elaborate super structures
4. Rover Core (a rover core without torque so its harder to flip your rover in low-grav situations)

Future Planned Items
1. Hinged Fairlings, because they look cool.
2. Flag, make your mark on alien soil.
3. Pocket Landing Gears, for when you want to be fancy!
4. Walker system, cause rolling is for wusses.
